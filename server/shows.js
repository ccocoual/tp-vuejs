The story starts in the year 2005, when then twenty-seven year old architect Ted was spurred on to want to get married after his best friends from his college days at Wesleyan, lawyer Marshall Eriksen, who was his roommate at the time and kindergarten teacher Lily Aldrin, got engaged after nine years of dating each other. Ted's new quest in life was much to the dismay of his womanizing friend, Barney Stinson. But soon after Marshall and Lily's engagement, Ted believed that his life mate was going to be news reporter and aspiring news anchor Robin Scherbatsky, who, despite having had a romantic relationship with her after this time, ended up being who the kids know as their \"Aunt\" Robin. As Ted relays the story to his kids, the constants are that their Uncle Marshall, Aunt Lily, Uncle Barney and Aunt Robin are always in the picture and thus have something to do with how he got together with their mother.",

        "description": "After a violent shipwreck, playboy billionaire Oliver Queen had disappeared and been presumed dead for five years before being discovered alive on a remote island in the Pacific. When he returns home to Starling City, his devoted mother Moira, the beloved sister Thea, and his best friend Tommy are going to welcome him home, but they have the feeling that Oliver has changed because of his terrible experience on the island. Meanwhile, Oliver hides the truth about the man he has become, he is desperate to repair the actions he took as the child he was. More particularly, he seeks reconciliation with his ex-girlfriend, Laurel Lance.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, Oliver plays the role of a rich, carefree and careless womanizer as he used to be - flanked by his devoted chauffeur / bodyguard, John Diggle - while carefully concealing the secret identity. However, Laurel's father, Detective Quentin Lance, is determined to stop the operation of the vigilante in his city. Meanwhile, Oliver's own mother, Moira Queen, knows much more about the deadly shipwreck than she has let on and is more cruel than she could ever imagine.",
